Building a production ready chat room on top of google cloud’s serverless infrastructure and Firebase’s data store. Working with: React Hooks, Custom Hooks, Authentication, Cloud functions, Realtime updates, Error logging, and Date-FNS. Built as part of course with ReactTraining.com. Tested myself throughout the course by first trying to implement different features. Excited to continue building projects with this knowledge and experience!
