Built a production ready chat room on top of google cloud’s serverless infrastructure and Firebase’s data store. Built as part of course with ReactTraining.com.

- Worked with: React Hooks, Custom Hooks, Authentication, Cloud functions, Realtime updates, Error logging, and Date-FNS. 

- Tested myself throughout the course by first trying to implement different features. Excited to continue building projects with this knowledge and experience! 

- firebaseConfig needed for app to work.
    Inside Firebase Project Settings General you can find your firebaseConfig at the bottom of page. The page section is labeled Firebase SDK snippet.
